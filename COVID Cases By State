## This project is exploring COVID cases, deaths and vaccinations by State. Datasets were downloaded from the CDC website and queried in BigQuery. 
## Data was used to create visualizations on Tableau.

## First dataset downloaded included data of COVID cases reported by state. 
## Queried data to obtain list of cases and deaths reported by state each day

SELECT 
  submission_date,
  state,
  new_case,
  new_death
FROM
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.casesbystate` 
  

## Second dataset downloaded included data of COVID vaccinations by state.
## First query was to filter only the column needed for the project.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent,
  Series_Complete_5Plus AS vac_5yr, 
  Series_Complete_5PlusPop_Pct AS vac_5yrpercent,
  Series_Complete_18Plus AS vac_18yr,  
  Series_Complete_18PlusPop_Pct AS vac_18yrpercent, 
  Series_Complete_65Plus AS vac_65yr,
  Series_Complete_65PlusPop_Pct AS vac_65yrpercent,
  Additional_Doses AS first_booster, 
  Additional_Doses_Vax_Pct AS first_booster_percent
FROM 
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
  
## Organized data by state to identify US territories included in the list.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location
FROM 
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
ORDER BY 
  location
  
## Next query was to see when the data was last updated.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent
FROM 
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
ORDER BY 
  date DESC

## Last date that states reported vaccination was '2022-06-29', I used this date to pull most recent data.
## Next query was to see which five states had the lowest vaccination precentage not including US territories.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent
FROM 
`course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
WHERE 
  date = '2022-06-29'
AND 
  location NOT IN ('AS', 'PW', 'MP', 'PR', 'GU', 'IH2', 'MH', 'BP2', 'DD2', 'VA2', 'VI')
ORDER BY 
  fully_vac_by_percent
LIMIT 5

## Then ran it again to see the top five state for vaccination precentage.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent
FROM 
`course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
WHERE 
  date = '2022-06-29'
AND 
  location NOT IN ('AS', 'PW', 'MP', 'PR', 'GU', 'IH2', 'MH', 'BP2', 'DD2', 'VA2', 'VI')
ORDER BY 
  fully_vac_by_percent DESC
LIMIT 5
