## This project is exploring COVID cases, deaths and vaccinations by State. Datasets were downloaded from the CDC website and queried in BigQuery. 
## Data was used to create visualizations on Tableau.

## First dataset downloaded included data of COVID cases reported by state. 
## Queried data to obtain list of cases and deaths reported by state each day

SELECT 
  submission_date,
  state,
  new_case,
  new_death
FROM
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.casesbystate` 
 
  
## Second dataset downloaded included data of COVID vaccinations by state.
## First query to pull information about number of people fully vaccinated and vaccination precent then by age category.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent,
  Series_Complete_5Plus AS vac_5yr, 
  Series_Complete_5PlusPop_Pct AS vac_5yrpercent,
  Series_Complete_18Plus AS vac_18yr,  
  Series_Complete_18PlusPop_Pct AS vac_18yrpercent, 
  Series_Complete_65Plus AS vac_65yr,
  Series_Complete_65PlusPop_Pct AS vac_65yrpercent,
  Additional_Doses AS first_booster, 
  Additional_Doses_Vax_Pct AS first_booster_percent
FROM 
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
  
## Organized data by state to identify US territories included in the dataset.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location
FROM 
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
ORDER BY 
  location
  
## Next query was to see the most recent date that the dataset was updated.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent
FROM 
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
ORDER BY 
  date DESC

## Last date that states reported vaccination information was '2022-06-29', I used this date to pull most recent data.
## Next query was to see which five states had the lowest vaccination precentage not including US territories.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent
FROM 
`course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
WHERE 
  date = '2022-06-29'
AND 
  location NOT IN ('AS', 'PW', 'MP', 'PR', 'GU', 'IH2', 'MH', 'BP2', 'DD2', 'VA2', 'VI')
ORDER BY 
  fully_vac_by_percent
LIMIT 5

## Then ran the query again ordering by DESC to see the top five state with the highest vaccination precentages.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_Yes AS num_fully_vac, 
  Series_Complete_Pop_Pct AS fully_vac_by_percent
FROM 
`course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` 
WHERE 
  date = '2022-06-29'
AND 
  location NOT IN ('AS', 'PW', 'MP', 'PR', 'GU', 'IH2', 'MH', 'BP2', 'DD2', 'VA2', 'VI')
ORDER BY 
  fully_vac_by_percent DESC
LIMIT 5

## The last query was to see the state vaccination totals by age group.

SELECT  
  date, 
  location, 
  Series_Complete_5Plus AS vac_5yr,
  Series_Complete_18Plus AS vac_18yr,
  Series_Complete_65Plus AS vac_65yr
  vac_5yr - vac_18yr AS age_5_to_18,
  vac_18yr - vac_65yr AS age_18_to_65
FROM 
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine`
WHERE 
  date = '2022-06-29' 
ORDER BY 
  location

## Datasets were not joined in BigQuery because I wanted to join them in Tableau instead. 
## If I was to join them in BigQuery, I would have used the query below.

SELECT 
  vaccine.date,
  vaccine.location,
  vaccine.Series_Complete_Yes,
  vaccine.Series_Complete_Pop_Pct,
  cases.new_cases,
  cases.new_deaths
FROM
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.casesbystate` AS cases
INNER JOIN
  `course-3-projects-353918.health.vaccine` AS vaccine
ON
  cases.submission_date = vaccine.date 
ORDER BY
  cases.submission_date
