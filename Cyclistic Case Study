## This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

## In this project I am assisting a bike rental company, Cyclistic to determine how to convert casual riders to memebers.
## I was provided with the past 12 months of ride data. I started the cleaning process in Excel and then uploaded the files to BigQuery.
## See blog post for more information about the case study.

##First I created a table with all 12 months of data.
