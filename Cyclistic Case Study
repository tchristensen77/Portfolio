## This is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

## In this project I am assisting a bike rental company, Cyclistic to determine how to convert casual riders to memebers.
## I was provided with the past 12 months of ride data. I started the cleaning process in Excel and then uploaded the files to BigQuery.
## See blog post for more information about the case study.

##First I created a table with all 12 months of data.

SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.apr2022rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.aug2021rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.dec2021rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.feb2022rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.jan2022rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.jul2022rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.jun2022rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.mar2022rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.may2022rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.nov2021rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.oct2021rides`
UNION ALL
SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.sep2021rides`

## Next identified how many rows contained null values.

SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allridesdata` 
WHERE start_station_name IS NULL
OR end_station_name IS NULL

## Null values made up 7% of all ride. I decided that this was an acceptable amount to remove from the dataset.
## I created a new table without null values and added a column with the starting and ending stations so I would be able to analyze specific routes.

SELECT ride_id, rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, day_of_week, ride_length, start_station_name, end_station_name, member_casual,
CONCAT(start_station_name, ' to ', end_station_name) AS route
INTO allrides
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allridesdata` 
WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL
OR end_station_name IS NOT NULL

## Now that I had the table created, I wanted to start getting basic information about the data.
## The number of rides per bike type.

SELECT rideable_type, COUNT(rideable_type)
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY rideable_type

## The number of ride per renter typer (member vs casual).

SELECT member_casual, COUNT(member_casual)
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY member_casual

## The number of routes by renter type.

SELECT route, COUNT(route) AS COUNT
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
WHERE member_casual = 'casual'
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY COUNT(route) DESC

SELECT route, COUNT(route) AS COUNT
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
WHERE member_casual = 'member'
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY COUNT(route) DESC

## Next I wanted to look at the most popular station for people to rent bikes from.

SELECT start_station_name, count(start_station_name)
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY start_station_name
ORDER BY COUNT(start_station_name) DESC
LIMIT 10

## And the 10 most least popular starting stations.

SELECT start_station_name, count(start_station_name)
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY start_station_name
ORDER BY COUNT(start_station_name) 
LIMIT 10

## Next I repeated this for ending stations and for routes.

SELECT end_station_name, count(end_station_name)
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY end_station_name
ORDER BY COUNT(end_station_name) 
LIMIT 10

SELECT route, COUNT(route)
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY COUNT(route) 
LIMIT 10

## Next I broke it down by the most popular routes for members and casual riders.

SELECT route, COUNT(route) AS COUNT
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
WHERE member_casual = 'member'
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY COUNT(route) DESC
LIMIT 15

SELECT route, COUNT(route) AS COUNT
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
WHERE member_casual = 'casual'
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY COUNT(route) DESC
LIMIT 15

## I noticed that many of the top routes where starting and stoping at the same station.
## So I wanted to see how many trips did this for each renter type.

SELECT member_casual,start_station_name, end_station_name, COUNT(member_casual) AS count
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY member_casual, start_station_name, end_station_name
HAVING start_station_name = end_station_name
AND member_casual = 'casual'
ORDER BY COUNT(member_casual) DESC

SELECT member_casual,start_station_name, end_station_name, COUNT(member_casual)
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY member_casual, start_station_name, end_station_name
HAVING start_station_name = end_station_name
AND member_casual = 'member'
ORDER BY COUNT(member_casual) DESC

## Next I wanted to determine that number of rentals for each bike type per each month to see if there was any trend on bike types during certain months or seasons.

SELECT  rideable_type, COUNT(rideable_type) AS count
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
WHERE started_at BETWEEN '2022-01-01 00:00:00 UTC' AND '2022-01-31 23:59:59 UTC'
GROUP BY rideable_type

## Next I looked at the number of rentals/weekday/month by bike type and by renter type.

SELECT member_casual, day_of_week, rideable_type, COUNT(day_of_weeK) AS count
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
WHERE started_at BETWEEN '2021-12-01 00:00:00 UTC' AND '2021-12-31 23:59:59 UTC'
GROUP BY member_casual, rideable_type, day_of_week

## Once I had this information, I wanted to know the difference in the avg rental times for members and casual riders

SELECT member_casual, 
  AVG(DATE_DIFF(ended_at,started_at, minute))
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY member_casual

## Finally I wanted to see how many rides where started during each hour of the day broken down by member and casual riders.

SELECT 
  EXTRACT(hour FROM started_at) AS hour_ride_started, 
  COUNT(rideable_type) AS num_of_rides, 
  member_casual
FROM `case-study-356622.cyclistic.allrides`
GROUP BY hour_ride_started, member_casual
ORDER BY hour_ride_started
